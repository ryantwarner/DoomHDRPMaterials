# DoomHDRPMaterials
Unity HDRP Materials from Doom (1993)

These materials can be used in conjunction with the Unity Doom WAD loader, just load the level in the editor and use the FBX exporter while the game is running to export the geometry as a model.

I created Mask Maps and Emission textures for the textures found here:
